    <h1><b>Java Programming - A Modern Approach to Object-Oriented Programming</b></h1>

    <p><strong>Java</strong> is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is widely used for building enterprise-grade applications. It was developed by <strong>James Gosling</strong> at <cite>Sun Microsystems</cite> and released in 1995.</p>

    <p><q>Write Once, Run Anywhere</q> â€” this popular slogan reflects Java's platform independence, achieved through the use of the <abbr title="Java Virtual Machine">JVM</abbr>.</p>

    <p>
        Java follows the <mark>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)</mark> paradigm, making it ideal for modular and maintainable code. It supports important OOP concepts like <em>Encapsulation</em>, <em>Inheritance</em>, <em>Polymorphism</em>, and <em>Abstraction</em>. 
        Java is widely used in <ins>Android Development</ins>, <ins>Web Applications</ins>, and <ins>Desktop Software</ins>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Compared to low-level languages, Java hides complex memory management tasks (like pointers) and offers a built-in <abbr title="Automatic Memory Management">Garbage Collector</abbr>. Its strong memory model and multithreading support make it ideal for high-performance applications.
    </p>

    
    <p>Java's syntax is similar to C and C++, making it easy for programmers familiar with these languages to learn Java quickly. It also has a rich set of libraries and frameworks. </p>

    <blockquote><p><strong>Basic Hello World program in Java:</strong></p></blockquote>
    <blockquote><strong>Syntax:</strong></blockquote>
    <pre>
        <code>
            public class HelloWorld 
           {
                public static void main(String[] args) 
               {
                System.out.println("Hello, World");
               }
           }
        </code>
    </pre>

    <blockquote><p>Output: <samp>Hello, World</samp></p></blockquote>
    
    <p><strong>Tip: </strong>Use keyboard shortcuts like: <kbd>Ctrl+Alt+N</kbd> to <strong>Run</strong> the Code. </p>
    
<p><small>Note: Java uses <abbr title="Unicode Transformation Format">UTF</abbr> encoding for character representation.</small></p>
