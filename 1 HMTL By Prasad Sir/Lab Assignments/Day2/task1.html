<h1>HTML Presentational & Formatting Tags</h1>
<p>This page provide an extensive demonstration of various HTML tags specifically designed for text formatting and presentation. It highlights how these tags influence the visual appearance and semantic meaning of content without relying on external CSS.</p>
<hr>

<h3>Text Styling and Emphasis Tags</h2>
<p>These tags are used to apply common text styles like bold, italic, underline, and to convey different levels of emphasis or semantic meaning.</p>

<h3>Bold and Strong Emphasis</h4>
<p>This sentence contains text that is rendered in a <b>bold</b> font style using the b tag. The b tag is typically used for visually bolding text without adding any special semantic importance.</p>
<p>Conversely, this sentence has text that conveys <strong>strong importance</strong>  using the strong tag. While it often renders as bold, its primary purpose is to indicate that the content is of great importance or seriousness.</p>
<p>Consider using strong for keywords in a warning or critical information, and for names in an article or product names that donâ€™t need semantic emphasis.</p>

<h3>Italic and Emphasized Text</h3>
<p>Here, we have text that is displayed in an <i>italic</i> font using the i tag. The i tag is generally used for text that needs to stand out visually, such as technical terms, foreign words, or thoughts.</p>
<p>This sentence showcases text that is <em>emphasized</em> using the em tag. The em tag adds semantic emphasis, implying that the content should be stressed or pronounced differently.</p>
<p>For instance, use em when you want to emphasize a word in a sentence to change its meaning, and i tag for titles of works or scientific names.</p>

<h3>Underlined and Inserted Text</h2>
<p>This text is <u>underlined</u> using the u tag. Historically, this was used for visual underlining, but it's now often discouraged for non-hyperlink text to avoid confusion. It can be used to represent text that is unarticulated but explicitly rendered as if underlined, such as misspellings.</p>
<p>This text is <ins>inserted</ins> using the ins tag. This tag semantically indicates content that has been added to a document, often rendered with an underline.</p> 
<p>You can also specify a datetime attribute for ins to indicate when the content was inserted:
<ins datetime="2023-01-15">New content added on Jan 15, 2023</ins></p>

<h3>Strikethrough and Deleted Text</h2>
<p>This text is <s>struck through</s> using the s tag. This tag indicates content that is no longer accurate or relevant, but should not be removed from the document. It's purely presentational.</p>   
<p>This text is <del>deleted</del> using the del tag. This tag semantically indicates content that has been removed from a document, often rendered with a strikethrough.</p> 
<p>Similar to ins, del can also have a datetime attribute:
Old price: $29.99 <del datetime="2023-01-15">New price: $24.99</del> </p> 

<h3>Subscript and Superscript</h2>
<p>Chemical formulas often use subscripts, like H<sub>2</sub>O (water) where the '2' is a sub element.</p>
