<body>
    <p>Mathematical expressions or ordinal indicators use superscripts, such as E=mc² or 10ᵗʰ, where the '2' and 'th' are sup elements.</p>

    <h3>Marked (Highlighted) Text</h3>
    <p>The mark tag is used to <mark>highlight</mark> or mark text that is of particular relevance in the context of the surrounding content, often rendered with a yellow background.</p>

    <h3>Small Text</h3>
    <p>This is normal text, and this is <small>small text</small> using the small tag. It typically represents side comments, copyright, or legal disclaimers.</p>

    <h3>Cited Work</h3>
    <p>The cite tag is used to denote the title of a work. For example, as famously quoted from <cite>Hamlet</cite> by William Shakespeare, "To be or not to be, that is the question."</p>
    <p>Another example: The theory was first proposed in <cite>On the Origin of Species.</cite></p>

<h2>Code, Variables, and Preformatted Text</h2>
<p>These tags are crucial for displaying programming code, user input, sample output, and preserving text formatting.</p>

<h3>Code Snippets</h3>
<p>For inline code, use the code tag. For example, to print "Hello, World!" in Python, you would use print("Hello, World!").</p>
<p>When defining a function in JavaScript: <code>function greet() { console.log("Hi!"); }</code></p>

<h3>Keyboard Input</h3>
<p>The kbd tag indicates user input, typically from a keyboard. To save a document, press <kbd>Ctrl + S</kbd>. </p>
<p>Another example: To copy text, use <kbd>Ctrl + C</kbd>.</p>

<h3>Sample Output</h3>
<p>The samp tag represents sample output from a computer program. If the command fails, you might see: <samp>Error: Permission denied</samp>.</p>
<p>After a successful compilation, the console might display: <samp>Build successful (0 warnings, 0 errors)</samp>.</p>

<h3>Variables</h3>
<p>The var tag is used to define a variable in a mathematical expression or programming context. In the formula for the area of a circle, A = πr², <var>A</var> represents the area and <var>r</var> represents the radius. </p>
<p>Another example:Let <var>x</var> be the number of apples.</p>
